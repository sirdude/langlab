oprhaned idents: ident is not on rhs and not entrypoint
undefined idents: ident is not on lhs
overlaping keywords for vs foreach
lhs = rhs
duplicate rules
lhs = 1 literal (can probably remove it)
subsets that overlap: 0-9 vs hex (0-9,a-f,A-F), hex should be num | a-f | A-F?
no entrypoint? (Default is first rule?)
lhs not a single ident
