(x) is not the same as x
() is the empty list
Lists of lists: ((a b) (c d)) or ((fred) ((x)))
Scheme lists can contain items of different types: (1 1.5 x (a) ((7)))
Here are some important functions that operate on lists:
length -- length of a list
equal? -- test if two lists are equal (recursively)
car -- first element of a list
cdr -- rest of a list
cons -- make a new list cell (a.k.a. cons cell)
list -- make a list

(define (my-max3 x y z)
   (if (and (> x y) (> x z))
       x
       (if (> y z) 
            y
            z)))
