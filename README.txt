This is a fresh start at a new programming language.

The goal of this project is to define a minimal ultimate language,
designed in itself and documented.
write a bootstrapper in perl.
Then extend it to be more robust, through its own language.
Figure out how to support objects, processes, vms, interpreters?
and or other abstracted structures

I've combined all of the stuff from my other projects into this one repository.
Right now its still a little bit of a mess and needs some organization.
There are a bunch of half done things and lots of notes.
