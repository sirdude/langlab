This is a fresh start at a new programming language.

The goal of this project is to define a minimal ultimate language,
designed in itself and documented.
write a bootstraper in perl.
Then extend it to be more robust, through its own language.
Figure out how to support objects, processes, vms, interpreters?
and or other abstracked structures

I've combined all of the stuff from my other projects into this one repository.
Right now its still a little bit of a mess and needs some organization.
There are a bunch of half done things and lots of notes.

Need to merge current bin/lib with stages.
bin/lib is old perl/lpc stuff
stages was an attempt to moduleralize things.

After that will probabably need to clean up the test suite.
Then it will be time to work on new things.
