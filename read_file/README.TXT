This program reads in source code and converts it to an AST of chars
It also does a bit of preprocessor work, reading in strings and comments
as well.

The code is written in 3 example languages:
	c, perl, lpc, 

as well as our new langauge.  The idea is to write the code so it is similar
in each language to experiment with our language and try to make it better.
More consise, clean and consistant.
